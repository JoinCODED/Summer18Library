# JavaScript Episode 5

In this exercise we're going to build a functioning chat application called Chatr.
It will use Axios to make requests to a Django API server that we have up and running.

## Instructions

**Fork** this repository and clone your fork (make sure you clone it into your `development` directory).

You should have the following directory layout

```
.
├── /css/                # CSS folder
│   └── /style.css       # Basic CSS stylesheet
├── /js/                 # JavaScript folder
│   └── /app.js          # Main app source
├── .gitignore           # Version control omission file
│── index.html           # Main entry point
└── README.md            # This file
```

You can run the project by opening `index.html`:

```
$ cd JSEpisode5/
$ open index.html
```

You're going to be editing `app.js`.

You'll find the instructions on [warehouse](http://warehouse.joincoded.com/workshop/javascript-episode-v/exercise/chatr/)

## Extra Stuff

Chatr works by making requests to a Django API built using Django Rest Framework.
